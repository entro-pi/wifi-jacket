This is a jacket that shows the current radio signal strength at a given location.

It's not limited to wifi/radio/cell, and has the ability to switch between
the three. (and any more I can find sensors for)

A line of LEDs run up the right or left arm of the jacket, and can
be switched so "full" brightness is either the most signal, or the
least.

It is currently in imagination stage.
